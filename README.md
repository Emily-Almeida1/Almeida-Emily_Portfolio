#### Personality Test Application
 - The “Which Disney princess” personality test is a test that asks ten questions with three different alternatives seeking to collect the answers from the user and then calculate them based on a number-letter system and give the user a corresponding princess.

##### -How did you come up with this project? What problem did you set out to solve, and why was it a problem that needed to be solved?

I decided to develop a personality test application inspired by the childhood figures I grew up with: Disney Princesses. I selected three of my favorite princesses and created a series of questions based on their traits—such as their favorite colors, professions, hobbies, and core values.
One of the main challenges I aimed to address was the level of accuracy and concentration required for the project to function correctly. I used Python 3 on the JDoodle platform and had to ensure that the code matched each answer precisely. Even a small typo or inconsistency in the questions or answers could result in incorrect personality matches. Solving this problem was essential to ensure the reliability of the test results.
##### -Tools I used:

JDoodle (Python 3)

Google Docs

Images (to support my learning as a visual learner)

##### -Challenges I faced:
One significant challenge I encountered was getting the code to function as intended. Initially, the test continued even when users input full sentences instead of the expected single-letter answers. This caused the program to produce inaccurate or random results. I overcame this by seeking help from a classmate, who helped me identify the issue. With their guidance, I was able to correct the input handling in my code and make the test work as expected.

##### -Other Resources:
I collaborated with a classmate who helped me troubleshoot and improve the code.

##### -Result:

My goal was to create a personality test that could identify which Disney Princess a user is most similar to. I successfully achieved this goal. If I had the opportunity to continue developing the project, I would include more princesses and design more detailed questions that allow for full-sentence responses. This would enhance the accuracy of the test and help users feel a deeper sense of connection with the result.

####  Excel Project: Emily Business' Exclusive Handbags

 - The Emily Business “Exclusive Handbags” is an Excel worksheet that contains 15 different handbags or purses and their characteristics. It has financial information such as the original cost, the selling cost, and the estimated profit. It also has expected loans that the business would take, and how much I would have to pay back at different interest rates and years of repayment.

##### -How did you come up with this project? What problem did you set out to solve, and why was it a problem that needed to be solved?

For this project, I was instructed to create a business around any type of product or service. While options included cars, grocery stores, books, or glasses, I chose to create a business focused on selling exclusive bags and purses.
A key problem I encountered involved working with large numbers in Excel. When entering prices over $1 million, I didn’t realize Excel cells were too short to display or properly process the full value. This led to incorrect calculations—such as adding $200,000 to $1 million and receiving a total that was even less than the original value. Solving this issue was crucial to ensure accuracy in calculating profits and potential future loans, which relied heavily on properly functioning formulas.

##### -Tools I used:

Excel

Google (for researching purse prices and market trends)

##### -Challenges I faced:
One challenge I faced was forgetting to set the cell format in Excel to “currency.” As a result, the prices I entered were treated as plain numbers instead of monetary values, which led to errors in calculations. I overcame this by reformatting all 15 original price entries to display as currency. Although it took some time, I learned the importance of not assuming that numbers and currency are interchangeable—a simple symbol like “$” can make a significant difference.

##### -Other Resources:
I used various online resources, including articles about the exclusivity and value of designer purses. These sources helped me classify the bags in my business by rarity and demand. Based on that information, I set different profit margins—higher for rare, hard-to-get items, and standard for items that were more accessible or widely available.

##### -Result:
My goal was to build a well-organized business chart that included key elements such as inventory, pricing, and profitability. I successfully achieved that, incorporating color coding to clearly distinguish different areas. I also ensured that all formulas worked accurately and reflected the correct values based on the data entered.
If I were to expand this project, I would implement more advanced features, such as discount strategies and profit simulations, to analyze whether specific offers would still yield acceptable margins.

#### Using Queries to make decisions

 - This project involved building a customer and product database using Microsoft Access. Through various queries, I was able to track purchases and outstanding balances, improving efficiency in managing store transactions.
   
 - [insert project 3 screenshot here]

##### -How did you come up with this project? What problem did you set out to solve, and why was it a problem that needed to be solved?
I decided to use Microsoft Access 2016 to create a database that tracks customers and the products they purchased from my store. The main issue I aimed to solve was the difficulty of manually keeping track of how many customers I had and how much money they owed. This was a time-consuming task, and creating a digital system helped streamline the process and improve accuracy.

##### -Tools I used:

Microsoft Access 2016

##### -Challenges I faced:
One of the initial challenges was deciding what kind of products my customers were purchasing. I selected items typically found at my university’s store. Another obstacle was learning to navigate the software itself. Creating and managing different queries was sometimes confusing, but by managing my time effectively and staying calm, I was able to overcome the difficulties and complete the project successfully.

##### -Other Resources:
I did not use any additional resources or collaborate with anyone on this project.

##### -Result:
My goal was to create a clear and functional database that would help me keep track of how much each customer owed and what items they had purchased. I achieved this, successfully managing customer and product information through organized queries.
If I were to develop this project further, I would add a column to track the purchase date of each item. This would allow me to easily determine payment due dates for each customer.
